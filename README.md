# My Portfolio

[Direct link to the live webpage.](https://kmk9000.github.io/MyPortfolio/)

Showcases my projects, with projects showcasing various individual implementations of different code languages. Only HTML, CSS and javascript so far, but more to come.

## Projects

### CSS showcases

These are CSS showcases, focusing on CSS implementation (implementing visual designs) and may not contain any real functionality.

* [Time Tracking Dashboard.](https://kmk9000.github.io/MyPortfolio/time-tracking-dashboard-main/index.html) (Frontend Mentor Challenge: Junior)
  * HTML/CSS implementation of a page designed by Frontend Mentor. Lacks mobile responsiveness currently as the Frontend Mentor did not provide a proper example of how the design should look on smaller screens in its downloadable files for this example. 

* [Testimonials Grid Section.](https://kmk9000.github.io/MyPortfolio/testimonials-grid-section-main/testimonials-grid-section-main/index.html) (Frontend Mentor Challenge: Junior)
    * HTML/CSS implementation of a page designed by Frontend Mentor. Contains mobile responsiveness.

    * HTML/CSS implementation of a class project for a desktop website designed for a fictional event.

### Javascript showcases

These are javacript showcases, focusing on javascript implementation and may not look very visually appealing.

* [Pancake Orders: Local Storage](https://kmk9000.github.io/MyPortfolio/pannukakku_vaihe3/pannukakku3.html)
  * Showcases the use of local storage to save orders made by a client, and a link to a "backend" where orders are assigned an id and given a status that can be changed by a user.

* [Zoo: Animal Type Database](https://kmk9000.github.io/MyPortfolio/pikku_el√§intarha/index.html)
